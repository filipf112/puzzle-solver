# Puzzle solver project in Matlab
## Implementation:

    1. Splitting the original image into smaller images
    2. Random placement of the images
    3. Utilization of phase correlation to place a smaller image within the original image and changing the puzzle piece's position.

## Tests:

    1. Impact of the number of puzzle pieces on the program's correctness
    2. Program's functionality with noisy images
    3. Program's performance with overexposed and underexposed images
    4. Test on a negative image
    5. Attempt to assemble an image with repeating patterns such as a chessboard

## User interface:

    1. Ability to load a file from the computer
    2. Option to set the number of puzzle pieces
    3. Option to reset the GUI
    4. Ability to preview all steps of the program's operation.
